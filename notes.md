# Meshroom
  Last week I used Regard3D for my models and it didn't seem to work out for me, so for this week I will try Meshroom to compare between the two. (aka which one worked better, was easier to navigate, etc.) For this I have downloaded the Meshroom desktop version instead of using the online method since I was a bit overwhelemed by it last week. 

  My first attempt will be the Groot figurine I tried last week to have a comparison, and then I will take photos of the gravestones I record this week if it is sucessful (or even if it isn't) to try.
  
  I added my photos and clicked Start. It took some time, but the program was able to make its way to DepthMap before experiencing some issues. I will start by googling "Meshroom depthmap falure" to see what comes up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loSMrBWxb1o)
