# Meshroom
  Last week I used Regard3D for my models and it didn't seem to work out for me, so for this week I will try Meshroom to compare between the two. (aka which one worked better, was easier to navigate, etc.) For his I have downloaded the Meshroom desktop version instead of using the online method since I was a bit overwhelemed by it last week.
