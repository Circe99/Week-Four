# Meshroom
  Last week I used Regard3D for my models and it didn't seem to work out for me, so for this week I will try Meshroom to compare between the two. (aka which one worked better, was easier to navigate, etc.) For this I have downloaded the Meshroom desktop version instead of using the online method since I was a bit overwhelemed by it last week. 

  My first attempt will be the Groot figurine I tried last week to have a comparison, and then I will take photos of the gravestones I record this week if it is sucessful (or even if it isn't) to try.
  
  I added my photos and clicked Start. It took some time, but the program was able to make its way to DepthMap before experiencing some issues. I will start by googling "Meshroom depthmap falure" to see what comes up. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loSMrBWxb1o) 
  
  I also came across this [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPdBQxZ9wEA) video
  
  After some research and help from Cocochantal, it seemed that my issue (add issue screenshot here) was the type of laptop I was using instead of the images themsleves. I was unable to figure out how to fix the issue other than getting the Nvidia. For now I will set this aside, and work on it more in the following weeks.

  Not overlly difficult, but I had to redownload Anaconda and Sublime to my laptop using these links [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
